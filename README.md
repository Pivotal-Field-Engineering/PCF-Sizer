#Getting Started
#Overview
For now we're using a simple spring boot ws project to serve static content. 
##Testing
We're using jasmine and karma. Get those installed via NPM. 

This [page](http://techportal.inviqa.com/2014/10/28/testing-javascript-get-started-with-jasmine/) is helpful for getting up to speed and figuring out which way is up. 

For this project you don't need to run the generators, as we've done that for you. In a nutshell: 

```
brew install npm
npm install -g yo
npm install -g bower
npm install -g karma
```

Tests are located in `shekel/src/main/resources/static/test/spec`.
